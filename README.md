IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing Yue Li(yul134)

In this repository, I have 4 java files that finished the program which meet the requirements, and 3 test files using mock, double and stub testing techniques mainly in TestVisitor file. Also, I have some other cases testing equivalence classes, boundary values.

In the testing process, I think any "should" or "must" in this program to looking for proper unit test cases. For example, "blogger" should dislike all locationsï¼Œ which I tested; using the doubled number generator to produce the same number when testing; using stubbed method to return a same value.

At first I spend too much time in the coding part. Thanks to SiYing Zhang, who took the course last semester, explained some key points and shared with me how to organize the code to be more testable to me.
