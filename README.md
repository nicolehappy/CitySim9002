IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing Yue Li(yul134)

In this repository, I have 4 java files that finished the program which meet the requirements, and 3 test files using mock, double and stub testing techniques. Also, I have some other cases testing equivalence classes, boundary values.

In the testing process, I think any "should" or "must" in this program to looking for proper unit test cases. For example, "blogger" should dislike all locationsï¼Œ which I tested; using the doubled number generator to produce the same number when testing; using stubbed method to return a same value.
